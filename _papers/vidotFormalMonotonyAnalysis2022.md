abstract: 'The use of ML technology to design safety-critical systems requires a complete
  understanding of the neural network''s properties. Among the relevant properties
  in an industrial context, the verification of partial monotony may become mandatory.
  This paper proposes a method to evaluate the monotony property using a Mixed Integer
  Linear Programming (MILP) solver. Contrary to the existing literature, this monotony
  analysis provides a lower and upper bound of the space volume where the property
  does not hold, that we denote ``Non-Monotonic Space Coverage''''. This work has
  several advantages: (i) our formulation of the monotony property works on discrete
  inputs, (ii) the iterative nature of our algorithm allows for refining the analysis
  as needed, and (iii) from an industrial point of view, the results of this evaluation
  are valuable to the aeronautical domain where it can support the certification demonstration.
  We applied this method to an avionic case study (braking distance estimation using
  a neural network) where the verification of the monotony property is of paramount
  interest from a safety perspective.'
