# Hello!

I am a PhD student at the [Edinburgh Center for Robotics' *Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) CDT*](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/) under the supervision of Prof. Ekaterina Komendenstkaya, Prof. Kathrin Stark and Dr. Grant Passmore.

My research focuses on applying formal methods to guarantee safety properties Artificial Intelligence systems, especially those relying on neural networks.

As part of the RAS CDT, I am affiliated with Heriot-Watt University and the University of Edinburgh and I am sponsored by [Imandra](https://www.imandra.ai/). I currently split my time between the Heriot-Watt campus, Imandra's Edinburgh office and the Bayes Center.

Previously, I studied Software Engineering at Epitech in France and got my MSc in Data Science from Heriot-Watt University.
