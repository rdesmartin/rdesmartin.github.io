I am a PhD student at the [Edinburgh Center for Robotics' *Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) CDT*](https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/) under the supervision of Prof. Ekaterina Komendenstkaya, Prof. Kathrin Stark and Dr. Grant Passmore.

My research focuses on applying formal methods to guarantee safety properties of autonomous systems, especially those using learning-enabled components like neural networks.

As part of the RAS CDT, I am affiliated with Heriot-Watt University and the University of Edinburgh and I am sponsored by [Imandra](https://www.imandra.ai/). I currently split my time between the Heriot-Watt campus, Imandra's Edinburgh offices.

Previously, I obtained an Master's degree in Software Engineering at Epitech in France and an MSc in Data Science from Heriot-Watt University.
