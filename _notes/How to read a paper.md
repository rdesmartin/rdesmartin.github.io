First read through: read introduction, motivation, contributions and conclusion. 

Ask the following question:
* What is the research investigating?
* Why did the research investigate this?
* What was found?
* Are the findings unusual or do they support other research in the field?
* What are the implications of the results?
* What experiments could be carried out to answer any further questions?

Only read the methods, detailed experiments, etc. if I want to reproduce the experiments or the paper is extremely relevant to my research (state of the art, "competition", etc.)
