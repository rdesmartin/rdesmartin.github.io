In this post I will lay down my plans for a 2-day bike trip leaving from Edinburgh, starting the ride from the railway station in Lairg, in the middle of the Highlands, to John o' Groats, Scotland's northeastern tip. John o' Groats is famous for being one extremity of the [Land's End to John o' Groat cycling trail](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/national-cycle-network/lands-end-to-john-ogroats-lejog/), that connects Great Britain's two futhest points, the other one being Land's End in Cornwall. I used to believe that John o' Groats was the northernmost point, but it is actually Easter Head on the nearby Dunnet Head peninsula.

# The Ride
The path we're planning to take is part of a [Sustrans route](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/national-cycle-network/lands-end-to-john-ogroats-lejog/) so it should be well indicated. It follows the A836 which goes straight North through the Highlands up to Tongue, then turns East along the coast through the towns of Melvich, Reay and Thurso all the way to John o' Groats.

After reaching John o' Groats, we can either go straight back to the closest train station in Thurso to catch a train back to Edinburgh, or if we still have some energy left, we can add a ~25km detour to Easter Head.

Overall it is a fairly intense ride, with 187km (211km with the Easter Head detour) and 1890m of uphill, but nothing that can't be done in 2 days. It is all on paved road, the first part from Lairg to Tongue on single-track road, the second part on 2-way road; hopefully it should be fairly quiet, at least on the first half.

# Logistics
## Getting to the Start and back from the end

## Eating and Sleeping
If you plan early enough, you can get a bed at the Tongue hostel, which is about half way through the trip. 
There are some pubs and village shops on the way so plenty of refueling opportunities.

## Paper Maps
In order to not be too dependent on my pone's battery and because I'm a helpless map nerd, I'm planning on getting some OS maps for the route, even though since we'll be following roads, it might be an unnecessary precaution. The whole ride is (almost entirely) covered by 3 OS maps:
* [OS Landranger 16: Map of Lairg & Loch Shin](https://shop.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/map-of-lairg-loch-shin/)
* [OS Landranger 10: Map of Strath Naver](https://shop.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/map-of-strath-naver/)
* [OS Landranger 12: Map of Thurso and Wick](https://shop.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/map-of-thurso-wick/)
