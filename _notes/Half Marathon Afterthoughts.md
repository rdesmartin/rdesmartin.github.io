Last Sunday I ran my second half-marathon ever in Glasgow, and my first-ever under 2 hours with a final time of 1h 48min 20s. I was so pumped that I immediately signed up for the Edinburgh Marathon next May. I wanted to take some notes about thoughts I had during and after the race. Some of these thoughts will seem obvious and it will become obvious that I was widely under-prepared, but my hope is that by writing them down now it will give me motivation for my full Marathon preparation. 

# Set a running pace before starting the race
I spent the first few kilometers making mental calculations about the pace I needed to hit in order to finish the race in under 2 hours. Mental math while running with a crowd of 10,000 was not ideal, and it prevented me from enjoying the atmosphere at the start of the race. Instead I kept re-counting to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my km-to-mile conversion.

# Invest in a running watch
I am a strong advocate of running with minimal equipment. In fact, I believe that what makes running such a great sport is that it can be practiced anywhere by any able person, you only need your legs and the ground (even though shoes are a nice bonus). But as I'm aiming for longer races and more ambitious times, I'm realising that knowing my pace while practicing and racing is becoming pretty important. I then have 2 solutions: 
* Train on fixed length courses, like a stadium or a treadmill
* Use a GPS to know my live distance and pace
The first option sounds very boring to me, especially since I train in Edinburgh, where there are so many beautiful running trails in and around the city. For the second option, I can use my phone but it is cumbersome and knowing my low DEX, if I have to frequently check my phone with my sweaty hands while running, I will drop it on day 1. 
The remaining option is to invest in a smart watch. I might also try to re-purpose the old open source smartwatch (a [Bangle.js 1](https://banglejs.com/)) I bought a few years ago; I tried to program it as a running watch when I first got it but it wasn't great. Maybe in the last few years the ecosystem has developed a nice running app, and hopefully I will be more persistent in making it work.

# Use orthotic soles
I ran the previous race without soles, and having them made a world of difference. No knee-pain, no shin pain, an absolute must. They are supposed to be specially made for running but I noticed that the front was quite squished after the race, so it is worth checking their state throughout the marathon preparation.

# Don't overdo the preparation
I'm currently checking marathon preparation plans, and almost all include running 5-6 days a week. Last time I did that when I was running track in highschool, I ended up not being able to run for 3 months because of shin splint. Take the preparation like the race: pace yourself, don't go to fast in the beginning. 

# OK is good enough
As I'm looking at the preparation plans, I'm 100% sure that I will not follow it to the letter. It's ok, in my past experience it's better to rest or do a 30-minute easy run when I'm not feeling like it.

# Start buying energy gel
They look like cat treat tubes and feel like eating Soylent, but they're much better than solid food. I tried to eat an energy bar and it almost gave me stitches. Another option would be to look into preparing home-made energy gels.

That's it for now, I might add more items as I get more running thoughts. I will also write a separate note on setting up the Bangle.js for running if I get around to do it. In the meantime, now that I can walk normally again I will resume training and go enjoy the fall colours on the [Roseburn path](https://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/roseburn-path-the-battle-over-whether-an-old-edinburgh-rail-line-should-become-a-tram-route-4602356) while it still exists.
