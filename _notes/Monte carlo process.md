The goal is to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event, i.e. sampling from random variable's distribution in order to compute some quantity.

> When we sample from a uniform distribution for the integers {1,2,3,4,5,6} to simulate the roll of a dice, we are performing a Monte Carlo simulation.
> We are also using the Monte Carlo method when we gather a random sample of data from the domain and estimate the probability distribution of the data using a histogram or density estimation method.

The more samples we take, the more accurate the approximation of the target distribution will be (law of large numbers) => can be computationally expensive to get an accurate result.
