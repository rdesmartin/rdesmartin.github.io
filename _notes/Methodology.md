# Reading Academic Papers

## Reading Methodology
Academic papers are not made to be read start to finish in one sitting. A better reading strategy is to read several times, with different level of attention to details each pass.

Before reading: read abstract (and skip intro/conclusion) to judge if this is relevant.

First read through: read introduction, motivation, contributions and conclusion. 

Ask the following question:
* What is the research investigating?
* Why did the research investigate this?
* What was found?
* Are the findings unusual or do they support other research in the field?
* What are the implications of the results?
* What experiments could be carried out to answer any further questions?

Only read the methods, detailed experiments, etc. if I want to reproduce the experiments or the paper is extremely relevant to my research (state of the art, "competition", etc.)

## Reading List

Keep a reading list of papers that are of interest, with short explanation why I want to read them (because it is easy to forget!) 
# Writing

It is hard/impossible to control exactly the output of a writing session. Instead of setting a content goal ("by the end of the week I will have written the introduction") set time goals ("by the end of the week I will have spent 5 hours writing") and stick to these goals.

Figure out most productive time of the day for focused work and set 1hr of writing each day, or set aside a single day only for writing.
