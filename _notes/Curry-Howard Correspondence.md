classical logic semantics: we need a lattice with negation/complement
constructive logic semantics: we don't have negation, so we define the relative pseudo-compelement

Proof system = syntax, inductively defined
Proving soundness (true in syntax implies true in semantics) is easy because syntax is inductive 
Proving completeness (true in semantics implies true in syntax) is hard because we quantify for all Heyting algebras and attribution function, which have properties but no syntax
