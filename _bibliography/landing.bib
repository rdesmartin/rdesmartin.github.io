abstract = {Neural networks are increasingly relied upon as components of complex safety-critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. There is high demand for tools and methods that embed neural network verification in a larger verification cycle. However, neural network verification is difficult due to a wide range of verification properties of interest, each typically only amenable to verification in specialised solvers. In this paper, we show how Imandra, a functional programming language and a theorem prover originally designed for verification, validation and simulation of financial infrastructure can offer a holistic infrastructure for neural network verification. We develop a novel library CheckINN that formalises neural networks in Imandra, and covers different important facets of neural network verification.},

  abstract = {The demand for formal verification tools for neural networks has increased as neural networks have been deployed in a growing number of safety-critical applications. Matrices are a data structure essential to formalising neural networks. Functional programming languages encourage diverse approaches to matrix definitions. This feature has already been successfully exploited in different applications. The question we ask is whether, and how, these ideas can be applied in neural network verification. A functional programming language Imandra combines the syntax of a functional programming language and the power of an automated theorem prover. Using these two key features of Imandra, we explore how different implementations of matrices can influence automation of neural network verification.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to their adoption in safety-critical systems, which in turn has heightened the need for guaranteeing their safety. These safety properties of DNNs can be proven using tools developed by the verification community. However, these tools are themselves prone to implementation bugs and numerical stability problems, which make their reliability questionable. To overcome this, some verifiers produce proofs of their results which can be checked by a trusted checker. In this work, we present a novel implementation of a proof checker for DNN verification. It improves on existing implementations by offering numerical stability and greater verifiability. To achieve this, we leverage two key capabilities of Imandra, an industrial theorem prover: its support for exact real arithmetic and its formal verification infrastructure. So far, we have implemented a proof checker in Imandra, specified its correctness properties and started to verify the checker's compliance with them. Our ongoing work focuses on completing the formal verification of the checker and further optimising its performance.},
