This digital garden template has separate notes for academic papers, which are automatically generated from a BibTeX bibliography file.

It is based on Maxime Vaillancourt's [great template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) and the paper notes management was inspired by Alistair Reid's [RelatedWork website](https://github.com/alastairreid/RelatedWork)

The original [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) still applies and is the best way to get started.
